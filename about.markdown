Hi there! I’m a **Senior Data Scientist** with a knack for research and development—and yes, I’ve spent some time teaching at the [Central University of Venezuela](http://www.ucv.ve/), which means I love sharing knowledge (and probably overexplaining things). Right now, I’m navigating the exciting chaos of being a PhD candidate at the [University of Granada](https://doctorados.ugr.es/tic/).

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I unpack interesting topics, share cool ideas, and sprinkle in some handy tips from my journey. But don’t expect dry textbook-style posts—this blog is all about keeping things light, fun, and maybe a little geeky. Let’s dive into the wonderful world of data, Python, and tech together! 

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mezaacor/),  explore my projects on [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mezaacor), and check out my publications on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronny-Meza)
