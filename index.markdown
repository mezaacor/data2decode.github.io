ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to my blog, where Iâ€™ll be sharing ideas and tips from my journey transitioning from Earth Sciences to Data Science. With a degree in Geophysical Engineering, I come from a multidisciplinary field where signal analysis, geostatistical models, and inversion methods are everyday tools for geoscientists.

I also spent several years working in a company that developed applications for the oil industry, during a time when data science was just beginning to gain momentum. These experiences have given me valuable "flying hours" in tackling complex data to build meaningful models.

This blog is my way of bridging that knowledge and sharing it with anyone eager to learn. Letâ€™s explore the fascinating world of data together!
